- The application must allow:
    - Add a book
    - Delete a book
    - Updating a book
    - Retrieve information from loaded books
- You will need Redux Toolkit for the state management of the application.
- This application will be the first one that, in a mandatory way, you will make with Responsive Design.
- You will be able to use the style libraries you like as well as all the libraries that you consider that add value to the product. to the product.
- For each book, maintain the consistency of the chosen language (ES/EN). 
(ES/EN) and must contain:
    - Title
    - Author(s) 
    - Year of publication
    - An image for the cover
    - A description or outline of the content
    - ISBN (If available) - Optional
- We are working with the best coding standards so we need everything to be written with the best so we need everything to be written with the implementations of ECMA6 and later of ECMA6 and later (functions, destructuring, among others).
- Design the mockup of the UI for Login & Register. Add these options to the options to the navbar or menu, depending on the style you choose.
- As an innovation, all teams will implement the SCRUM methodology.

Optionals
